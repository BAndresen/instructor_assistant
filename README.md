PADI Scuba Diving Instructors are required to complete the 'Record_and_Referral_Form' for every student after the PADI Open Water Course. The 'Instructor Assistant App' aims to make that process fast and easy. Completing one form takes approximatly 8 - 10mins per student by hand and 1 hour for a class of 6 students. With this tool Instructors should be able to complete paperwork for a full class in less then 5 minutes.
